<h3>Breaking Bad</h3>

<p>A riveting series that keeps getting better and better. While not recommended for the whole family, this show
does not fail to keep the viewer biting their nails with tension! <b>5/5</b></p>

<p>A show with an incredibly funny cast and unafraid of attempting bizare concepts in an homage to many works
of entertainment. With a hard focus on the characters, it is difficult to leave this show without heartfelt memories. <b>5/5</b></p>

<h3>Mr. Robot</h3>

<p>If you want a show that is a little more realistic about the world of hacking, this is it. Following the
mentally troubled characters is exciting and gets the viewer to want more. <b>4/5</b></p>

<h3>Parks & Recreation</h3>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/23/Parks_and_recreation_title.jpg">
<p>Using a mockumentary format similar to The Office, Parks and Rec is exceptional at providing great laughs
while preserving a heart that is admired within the characters. <b>4/5</b></p>
